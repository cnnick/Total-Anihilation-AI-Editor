
found there a bug in ESC 998 that AI will not build any CORE T1 Vehicle Plant without a global sets of Limit and Weight.

This means that if you set Limit and Weight of Plan(easy, medium, hard) as usual, AI will not build any CORE T1 Vehicle Plant.

To make sure the AI build CORE T1 Vehicle Plant, you need to add the global sets of Limit and Weight manually before "PLAN EASY" in AI text.  

	For a Exampleï¼š

		Limit CORVP 3

		Weight CORVP 0.6

		Plan easy

If you find any other units have same problem while test the AI, please try to solve it in the same way.
