
2-TA ESC 997 AI Enhanced Version 2 

Note: 997 has modified the main EXE program and added or deleted DLL files from 996, it is better to prepare a pure original TA rather than overwrite 996

The main changes are as follows:

I. Added AI resource units (invisible)
	-AI comes with secondary radar and automatic fire control, no full picture radar
	-Suitable for newcomers to play computer, from easy all the way to difficult

Resources increase by magnitude difficulty level
	- Simple, AI economy +20 metal +2000 energy
	- Medium, AI economy +40 Metal +4000 energy
	- Hard,   AI economy +80 metal +8000 energy
	- Because AI often makes more money than it earns, hitting the economy will seriously affect AI production in the later stages
